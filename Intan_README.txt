RHD2000 USB Interface Software - Source Code (v1.4.2)
----------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the RHD2000 Interface C++/Qt source code and two supporting files: main.bit
(the FPGA configuration file) and an operating system-specific Opal Kelly library file located in
the 'Opal Kelly library files' directory.

These two supporting files must reside in the directory with the executable file (i.e., the 'debug'
or 'release' folder generated when the code is compiled).  To find the executable directory on
a Mac, right-click on the RHD2000interface.app file generated by Qt, select "Show package contents",
and open the "MacOS" directory.  (Note: Some Mac users have reported that these two files must be
placed in the in same directory as the application instead.)

You should also download and install the USB drivers from the Intan Technologies website before
connecting the RHD2000 USB interface board to a computer.  (They are not included in this zip file.)
However, you can run the RHD2000 interface software in demonstration mode without installing drivers
or plugging in an interface board.

The C++ source code uses a handful of C++11 features, so g++ users may need to add -std=c++11 to their 
command line or make file.

This code is written and tested with Qt-4.8.6, not the current version, so you may need to download 
the older version.  On Windows, this means downloading and then recompiling with your current version 
of Visual Studio, as the distributed versions of Qt-4.8.6 were compiled with older versions of Visual Studio.

For production code, you should compile a Release build (Visual Studio) or use the optimization flag
-O3 (g++).  Otherwise, the compiled code may not be fast enough to keep up with how fast data streams
from the USB interface board.  This will show up as the FIFO lag becoming very high for debug builds.

Other Linux tips
----------------
Copy the libokFrontPanel.so file into the source folder.
Add the following line to the .pro file:
	unix:LIBS += -L./ -l okFrontPanel -ldl
Run qmake on the .pro file, and then make.


Other tips on Mac compilation from Tobias Teichert at Columbia University
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In principle, the RHD2000 software will run on a Mac. However, a couple of tweaks are necessary.
This description is based on exprience using two different machines running MacOSX 10.9

1) Install XCode

2) Install Qt5.2.1 (Make sure to install XCode first)

3) Modify the QT line in the .pro file to read
	QT  += widgets multimedia

4) Fix library issue as described here:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20342896/solved-qt5-1-qt5-2-mac-os-10-9-mavericks-xcode-5-0-2-undefined-symbols

   in /Qt5.2.1/5.2.1/clang_64/mkspecs/macx-clang/qmake.conf  (or similar)
   change QMAKE_MACOSX_DEPLYOMENT_TARGET from 10.6 to 10.9


5) add the QSound library to the mainwindow.cpp
	#include <QSound>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some users have reported that it is necessary to install Qt with 32-bit support for the 
okFrontPanel DLL to load properly.  But this was with an older version of the RHD2000 interface source
code that didn't support 64-bit, so it may not apply any more.

Recommended C++/Qt Resources
----------------------------

The total source code is around 10,000 lines in length, and is written entirely in C++ using the
open-source Qt libraries for multi-platform GUI support. (The files composing the core Rhythm API
are written in straight C++ without using Qt.)

There are countless books and other online resources related to C++ programming, so these will not
be discussed here. For C++ programmers new to Qt, the best place to start is http://qt-project.org.
We recommend downloading the Qt SDK (Software Design Kit) including Qt Creator, Qt Assistant, and the
latest Qt libraries for the operating system of choice.

The best book we have found for first-time Qt programmers is C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4, Second
Edition, by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield (ISBN 0-13-235416-0). Chapters 1-8 and 11-12, along
with Appendices A and B, cover nearly all the aspects of Qt used in the RHD2000 interface GUI. The
library documentation available in the Qt Assistant application is also excellent and indispensable.
